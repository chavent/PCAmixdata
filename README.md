## Description
This package is dedicated to factorial analysis and rotation of quantitative data, qualitative data, or mixed data. The PCAMIX method, proposed in this package includes the ordinary principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) as special cases. Orthogonal varimax rotation of the principal components of PCAMIX is also implemented in this package. Multiple Factorial Analysis (MFA) for data structured in groups of variables is also proposed. Variables can be quantitative, qualitative or a mixture of both within each group.
